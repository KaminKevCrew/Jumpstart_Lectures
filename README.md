# Jumpstart_Lectures
- This repo contains all of the lectures that I have created from the App Academy Jumpstart Curriculum.
- The "Homework" problems are, at this point, taken straight from the App Academy content. The solutions are my own.
- Any explanations of Enumerable methods are made by me, and the problems that follow are both created, and solved by me. 

The purpose of this repo is to build an easily accessible resource for App Academy Jumpstart Students that can be used in a local environment, as opposed to having to run everything through App Academy Online.
